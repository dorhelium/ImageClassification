**The goal of this project is to recognize the largest numeric value out of three hand-written numbers for each image in the modified MINIST dataset. A linear model was implemented to provide a good baseline for the clas- sification task. Then the experiments mainly focus on convolutional neural network(CNN), and specifically investigated the performance of the state-of-the-art Residual Network (ResNet). We discussed basic intuitions behind ResNet architecture, and presented some recent works on possible improvement on ResNet in last decade. A task-specific ResNet model was implemented and experimented with several factors such as the depth of network, different choices of optimizers, and the batch size. In the end, a final convolutional neural network pipeline is presented with a 97.6% accuracy on the held-out test set.**
